## Installation Instructions tested in a new DICE account

You can also find instructions in the coursework description (Section 3)

Open the terminal and write:

```bash
mkvirtualenv --python=`which python3` rl2021
```
This will create a virtual environment called 'rl2021' which you should use to work.

It's a python3 environment since python3 will be used during tests.

Every time you open a terminal you will need to activate the environment using:

```bash
workon rl2021
```

You should see then a parenthesis on your terminal as such:
```bash
(rl2021) [vulcan]s1873000:
```
Now clone the environment:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:uoe-agents/uoe-rl2021.git
```

Navigate and install using:
```bash
cd uoe-rl2021
pip install -e .
```

## CAREFUL! Your Forks are PUBLIC!
Forks in github are public, and usually easy to find by clicking the number next to your forks.

If you want to mirror the repository you can do it this way: https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/ and don't forget to make it private afterwards.

You could then add the original remote and pull any updates (a bit less convenient but...)

using:
```bash
git remote add coursework https://github.com/uoe-agents/uoe-rl2021.git
```
and pulling as:
```bash
git pull coursework master
```
or just clone and work locally.

## PyTest

Tests include checks for usage of correct variable names, the existance of files, and the types of function return values. Please, make sure your solutions pass the public tests.
To run them, navigate to the main folder `uoe-rl2021
and run:
```bash
pytest -v
```

## FAQ
- mkvirtualenv and others appear to not be installed?
In case you do not have installed virtualenv and its wrappers you should run (tested on DICE):
```bash
pip3 install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper
```
Then add the following lines at the end of your `.bashrc` file (found in your home directory)
```
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3
export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_VIRTUALENV=$HOME/.local/bin/virtualenv
source $HOME/.local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```
You should then restart your shell or run `source .bashrc`
